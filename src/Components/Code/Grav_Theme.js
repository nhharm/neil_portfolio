const textBlock = <p>GRAV is a free to use, easy to deploy, flat-file Content Management Solution (CMS) and a wonderful alternative to using paid for services such as WordPress and Drupple. GRAV uses a system of languages including Markdown, TWIG, YAML, along with more traditional web development languages, JavaScript and CSS.<br /><br />
Currently I am working on building out several custom themes (think WordPress custom themes/plugins) that take advantage of all the great backend CMS customizations that GRAV offers. My single page portfolio theme offers users a modular page build that can be customized in anyway. It uses pure JavaScript to create a series of dynamic page modules, including a customizable job history selector (code example below).</p>

const textBlock2 = <p>My other on-going GRAV theme is a general (non-goods) business, multi-page theme that has a dynamic home page, directing users to several areas including quotes and unique business highlights. This theme (named Leeander) was inspired by CAAâ€™s current website. Leeander Theme also provides users customizable color adjustments from the backend CMS and is fully customizable.<br /><br />
Both of these themes are on-going and are scheduled for deployment in early 2023.</p>
